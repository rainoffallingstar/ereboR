# FILL THIS IN! HOW CAN PEOPLE INSTALL YOUR DEV PACKAGE?
pak::pak("rainoffallingstar/ereboR")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example,eval=FALSE}
library(erebor)
## the upstream analysis of RNA-seq

BagginsClass$new(...)

## the upstream analysis of RRBS

SamwiseClass$new(...)

## download public data from TGCA/GEO

laml <- MoriaClass$new(mine = "TCGA-LAML",Dwarf_worker = "TGCA")
laml$download()

```
